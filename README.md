# Sequelize My Burger Please

Sequelize My Burger Please is a MySQL, Express, Handlebars Express and Sequelize CRUD site. It is the same as the "Burgers" site but with Sequelize. Together with the "Burgers" site it is our introduction to routing and to handlebars.

## How to Use

In this app the user enters the name of a hamburger and states whether or not the hamburger has been devoured. The data is stored in JAWS SQL data base. The user can then update this information by changing the hamburger's status from "devoured" to "undevoured" or vice-versa.
The user also has the option to delete the hamburger.
